The 5dpo Robotics Team accomplishes the 1st and 2nd places in the competion Robot@Factory 4.0. This competition requires that a robot transports boxes to
wherever needed. In the first leg, it is necessary to move the blue boxes
between the departure warehouse and the arrival warehouse. In the second leg,
the green boxes will have to go through one of the processing machines A or B.
Finally, in the third leg, the red boxes will have to go through two processing
machines sequentially. The objective is to transport as many boxes as possible
in the shortest time.
