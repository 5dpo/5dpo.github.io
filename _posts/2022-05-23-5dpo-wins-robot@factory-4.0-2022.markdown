A robot developed at INESC TEC's Centre for Robotics in Industry and Intelligent
Systems (CRIIS) by the 5dpo Robotics Team won the Robot@Factory 4.0, a
competition part of the National Robotics Festival, which took place from April
29 to May 1, in Santa Maria da Feira.

The challenge was to transport as many boxes as possible in the shortest time,
using an electromagnet, from a starting warehouse to a target warehouse, while
moving the boxes through specific processing machines according to their colour.
Said colour was introduced at beginning of the competition, and the robot had to
request this information to the server, in order to know the colour and position
of the boxes in the starting warehouse.

The competition was divided into three stages: the first involved transporting
four blue boxes only between warehouses; the second focused on moving two blue
and two green boxes through a processing machine; and the third involved moving
one blue, two green and one red boxes by two processing machines. Competing with
three other teams, INESC TEC's robot finished the race in first place,
transporting all the boxes, and completing the first stage in 2m04s7, the second
in 2m09s5 and the third stage in 2m15s3.

The differentiating factors of INESC TEC's robot were, on the one hand, a LiDAR
laser, which facilitated the location considering the poles in the corners of
the field, and, on the other hand, the mechanum wheels with omnidirectional
traction, which provided freedom of navigation in all directions. For the
development of this robot, which started about three months ago, the team
resorted to 3D modelling and design, location algorithms using laser data and
odometry (wheel data), as well as coordination, sequencing, and task assignment
actions.

The videos of INESC TEC's performance in each stage are now available in
YouTube:
