The 5dpo Robotics Team accomplishes the 1st and 2nd places in the Robot@Factory
4.0 competion. This competition requires that a robot transports boxes to
wherever needed. In the first stage, it is necessary to move the blue boxes
between the departure warehouse and the arrival warehouse. In the second stage,
the green boxes will have to go through one of the processing machines A or B.
Finally, in the third stage, the red boxes will have to go through two
processing machines sequentially. The objective is to transport as many boxes as
possible in the shortest time.

Several technologies were tested by the researchers of the 5dpo Robotics Team,
including PID-based controllers for motion control, the Dijkstra's algorithm for
path planning, and sensor fusion of wheel encoders, an Inertial Measurement Unit
(IMU), and laser beacons detection with Extended Kalman Filters (EKF).

The participation of the 5dpo Robotics Team in the Robot@Factory 4.0 competion
counted with the contribution of the following team members: António Paulo
Moreira, Cláudia Daniela Rocha, João G. Martins, João Pedro Costa, José Maria
Sarmento, José Pedro Carvalho, Maria S. Lopes, and Ricardo B. Sousa. Although
not participating in the competition, the researchers João Pedro and Vítor
Ventuzelos also contributed to the participation of the 5dpo team in the
competition.

Also, the competion Robot@Factory 4.0 counted with participation of other teams
from the
[Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto (FEUP)](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/)
and the
[Polytechnic Institute of Bragança (IPB)](https://portal3.ipb.pt/index.php/en/ipben/home).

Lastly, Robot@Factory 4.0 is organized by the
[_Sociedade Portuguesa de Robótica (SPR)_](http://www.sprobotica.pt/) at the
[_Festival Nacional de Robótica_](https://www.festivalnacionalrobotica.pt/). The
organizors are José Lima, Paulo Gomes da Costa, and Vítor Pinto.
